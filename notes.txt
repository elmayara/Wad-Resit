1,2 - generally OK, good explanation of web services in general. Note that the cURL code is
not relevant here; you only need to talk about thr web service itself.

3 - you have shown code but need more of an explanation. You need to discuss which errors
you check for (e.g. not enough rooms in the accommodation for that date) and explain which
HTTP code you would send back in each case and why.

4 - correct general procedure but more detail needed on how the JSON is parsed
into an array of JavaScript objects. Also it's requirement 1 you need to communicate
with, not requirement 3.


5 - This is not the correct approach; rather than setting up a new route on the
web service, you need to make a cURL request from VisitHampshire to your
requirement 2 with the location in the URL set to Hampshire.

6 - more detail needed on how you would use the GPS latitude and longitude to
set the position of the Leaflet map.

7 - more detail needed on how you extract the latitude and longitude from the JSON
and use them to create your marker.

8 - as for question 5, you need to use cURL here. You need to use cURL to connect to your Task 3 web service;
send a cURL POST request. See Topic 4.

Note that your web service did not work as you had a conflict between two of your
routes, /Hamps/{search term} and /Hamps/create. These both have the same pattern,
/Hamps/ followed by a string, and thus conflict. Once I had fixed this your web
service worked.

1,2 - fine.

3 - fine though you should not use 401 if there is no availability, 401 is 'unauthorised'
which means you're trying to access the web service without the correct authentication
(e.g. login details). You should also check if the accommodation ID exists or if the
date exists in the database.

4,6,7 - fine. A possible improvement is to delete the old markers from the previous
search before you do a new search.

5,8 - some code started but not completed.

Requirements completion: D1
Code quality: D1



Note this will be capped at 40% due to being a late submission.
